This is an implementation of a graphics editor that showcases capabilities of the C language and the BGI - Borland Graphics Interface. 
This could be very useful for someone starting out coding, learn C, C Graphics and utilize advanced costructs like XOR( I use this to create a drag and paste feature )

Requirements:
 * TurboC++ 3.0(with BGI: Borland Graphics Interface)
 * Dosbox(if running on Mac)
 * Dos on Windows 95/98/2000
